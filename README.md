# End-to-End Machine Learning Project and Deploy it to Heroku with Flask 

This repository is intended to walk you through all the major steps involved in completing an and-to-end Machine Learning project. For this project, Iâ€™ve chosen a supervised learning regression problem.

Here are the major topics covered:

1. Pre-requisites and Resources
2. Data Collection and Problem Statement
3. Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy
4. Data Preparation using Sklearn
5. Selecting and Training a few Machine Learning Models
6. Deploying the Final Trained Model on Heroku via a Flask App
7. Create a WebPage to call our deployed model and predict new values

We are using the Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Here is the link to the dataset:

Points 2,3,4,5 you can review them in the Notebook file


Point 6 you can see it in main.py file

The web page is deployed in Github Pages and you can find it in link below
